# Timestamp microservice
https://timestamps-microservice.herokuapp.com/

## Overview

Timestamp microservice is a lightweight microservice that accepts string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date. If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date. 

## Versions

- [**Standard**]: the simplest version.
- [**GUI**]: a slightly more complex version of the same application.

# Quick Start Guide

- I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016)
- If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
- If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.
